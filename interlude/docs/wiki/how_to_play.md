# The basics

While you play a song, **notes** will scroll along **columns**, towards the **receptors** at the end.
When a note lines up with the receptors, press the corresponding button for that column.

There are also "hold notes" or "long notes" - For these notes you must press and hold the key for the column until the tail of the note reaches the receptor, when you must release the key.

# Scoring

You are scored on your accuracy as you play, which is displayed as a percentage.  
The more accurately you timed your key press, the more points you get for each note.

For example in the SC scoring system, here's how points work:

- Within 22.5ms -> Marvellous -> 10 points
- Within 45ms -> Perfect -> 9 points
- Within 90ms -> Great -> 5 points
- Within 135ms -> Good -> 1 points
- Within 180ms -> Bad -> -5 point penalty
- Missing the note -> Miss -> -5 point penalty

Multiple scoring systems are available in Interlude, but the "official" one is SC.  
You can read more about alternative score systems on the [Rulesets](rulesets.html) page.
