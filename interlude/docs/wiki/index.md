# Welcome to the Interlude Wiki!

This is the place to go for extended information on how a particular feature works.  

Always remember that **lots of information** is available directly from the game client via tooltips on hover.  
The vast majority of the UI is navigatable using keyboard-only. In this case pressing `/` will bring up the tooltips.

I've taken the time to embed the wiki into the game client with the hope that I will actually start keeping it up to date, it's for when tooltips aren't enough for something to be self explanatory.  

I will try my best to keep this Wiki up-to-date and relevant, if you see something that doesn't look quite right or you want more information about a particular feature then be sure to let me know [in the Discord](https://discord.gg/tA22tWR).
