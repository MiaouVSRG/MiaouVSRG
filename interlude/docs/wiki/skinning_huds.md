# HUD layouts

A **HUD** layout folder consists of a `hud.json` and texture files for various elements.

For a guide on how texture files work, see the [introduction page](skinning.html).

A custom HUD layout allows you to:

- Toggle and reposition HUD elements which show during gameplay
- Change settings for HUD elements affecting their appearance and what they display
- Use textures as custom fonts or backdrops on some HUD elements

Examples of elements include: Accuracy and Combo indicators, Skip button, Timing display, etc.  

A full list with specific details may be written in future, for now *you can see a complete list ingame via the HUD editor*.
