# Noteskins

A **Noteskin** folder consists of a `noteskin.json` and texture files for various elements.

For a guide on how texture files work, see the [introduction page](skinning.html).

A custom Noteskin allows you to:

- Change how notes look
- Change the playfield size/column width
- Change the spacing between playfield columns
- Configure animations such as note explosions, lighting when you press a key, etc

A full guide on these options may be written in future, for now *you can see all your options ingame via the Noteskin editor*.
