Hi it's me again

# Improvements
- Experimental change to the engine/frame cap, to see if it affects the Intel Crash of Death
- You can now view wider "slices" of the score graph when holding shift + hovering
- New option to show timestamps next to PBs on the song wheel (found in Level select options)
- You can now change the osu! hold mechanics to something else via the ruleset editor

Editing osu! scorev1 LN windows still can't be done ingame but this will help players who are trying to modify an osu! ruleset to emulate ScoreV2
