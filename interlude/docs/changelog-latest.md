When you don't see it :(

# Improvements
- New setting to normalise short holds, to prevent visual issues with high values of Hold Note Trim
- Overhaul to import/library menus, mainly to improve the process of adding and removing links to other game's songs
- 'Vacuum' is no longer a hidden console command and can be run from the library menu
- Mod status is shown to remind you as you enter gameplay
- Some options have moved to better places, such as quit-out behaviour now being on the Gameplay options tab
- Column swap mod now shows columns as its shorthand, and scores now save
- Type `*` in the options menu search to see all possible search results
- All delete buttons are now red
- Various other small and subtle UI improvements

# Bug fixes
- Fixed black seams showing under certain circumstances with hold notes and other textures
- Reverted a change from last update that worsened windowed-mode latency for some users
