### MiaouVSRG

**MiaouVSRG** is a **work-in-progress** rhythm game project built upon the engine of **[YAVSRG](https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG)** (Yet Another Vertically Scrolling Rhythm Game), created by [@Percyqaz](https://github.com/YAVSRG).

Our goal is to deliver a fresh rhythm game experience, featuring:
- Lots of quality-of-life improvements
- A brand new cute, cat-inspired art style :3

A huge thanks to **Percyqaz** for giving us permission to build on his work and for his kind support throughout the development!

Check out [yavsrg.net](https://www.yavsrg.net) to learn more about the original project.

<h2 align="center">🐾 Getting Started with miaouVSRG 🐾</h2>

Welcome! This guide will walk you through setting up everything you need to start using the miaouVSRG project. Let's get things purring! 🐱💻

---

## 1. Install the Required Tools

Before diving in, please make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)  

Just follow the installation setup — you’ve got this! :3 ✨

---

## 2. Set Up the Repository

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you'd like to clone the project
# Don’t forget the --recurse-submodules part – it’s important!
git clone https://github.com/MiaouVSRG/miaouVSRG.git --recurse-submodules
```

---

## 3. Launch the CLI Tool

Navigate to the tools folder and run the CLI:

```bash
cd miaouVSRG/tools
dotnet run
```

You should see something like this in your terminal:

```
== YAVSRG CLI Tools ==
type 'help' for a list of commands, or help <command> for details
>
```

Looking good! 😺

---

## 4. Build and Launch the Game

Inside the CLI, type the following command to build and launch the latest version of the game:

```
play
```

This will compile the game and place the build in the `miaouVSRG/GAME` directory. From there, you can launch it directly!
