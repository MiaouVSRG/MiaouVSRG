### MiaouVSRG

**MiaouVSRG** is a **work-in-progress** rhythm game project built upon the engine of **[YAVSRG](https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG)** (Yet Another Vertically Scrolling Rhythm Game), created by [@Percyqaz](https://github.com/YAVSRG).

Our goal is to deliver a fresh rhythm game experience, featuring:
- Lots of quality-of-life improvements
- A brand new cute, cat-inspired art style :3

A huge thanks to **Percyqaz** for giving us permission to build on his work and for his kind support throughout the development!
