Last updated 12th June 2023. You can view the full history [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG/blame/master/site_data/privacy_policy.md).

## Summary of service

'**Interlude**' refers to [this site](https://yavsrg.net), the Interlude game client as available on [GitHub](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude), and any affiliated services

Interlude is developed and maintained by [Percyqaz](https://github.com/percyqaz)

Interlude provides its users with various online services accessible from within the game client and via the public Discord server, such as multiplayer lobbies, user profiles and tools to track your skill improvement.

Interlude's online services are available to all users, free of charge, anywhere in the world. 
In order to provide these services to users, Interlude stores and transmits personal information.

You do not need to use the online services when you use the Interlude game client, and if you do not want Interlude to collect or process your personal information you can play without using any of the online features.

By using Interlude's online services, you confirm that you have read and understood both this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Service](terms_of_service.html), and that your use of the services is subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

## What data gets collected

All personal data collected by Interlude comes directly from your interactions with the online services.

When you create your account, Interlude stores

- Your Discord ID
- Your username
- Your IP address

Your username is shared publicly with other users of Interlude. The other information is never shared publicly.

As you use Interlude, services may store

- Scores you submit online
- Your friends list
- Data about your current game session

### Logging
Interlude uses logging to collect technical information. This data may include chat messages you send in multiplayer lobbies, your username, IP address and other interactions with services.

Logging data is used solely to improve the services, and is only stored for as long as it is useful (about 2 weeks) before it is permanently deleted.

## How the data is stored/used

Your account information is held securely on servers in the United Kingdom, and never shared with any third parties outside of Interlude, except in a circumstance where it is necessary to confirm to legal requirements or comply with legal process.

Data such as your submitted scores and username are shared with other users of Interlude as part of the services provided.

Your discord ID or IP address may be used internally for moderation purposes.  
Examples include:  

- Contacting you through Discord regarding your account or a related issue
- Detecting multiple accounts for one user or account sharing


To respect your privacy, measures are taken to minimise or entirely prevent internal staff members from seeing this information directly.

## Your rights
