(*
    Action queuing
    The game has:
    - A "window thread" that handles input and window events
    - A separate "game thread" that handles rendering and game logic

    Often another background thread needs to queue up an action to be executed on the game thread
    Also commonly used to defer an action to happen at the start of next frame even when already on the game thread

    Deferred actions are fire-and-forget, they will execute in the order they are queued, when the thread gets around to it
